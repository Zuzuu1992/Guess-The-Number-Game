# Guess-The-Number-Game

This is a solution to the Guess The Number challenge!

## Overview
Guess The Number challenge I created displays plain input field and buttons with information so that players could easily navigate through 
the rules of the game.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Enter some numbers into the input field.
- Upon clicking the 'check' button, comparing input number to the random number, which is generated under the '?' mark box.
- Get hints when the number is higher or lower than random one.
- See their score and highscore change.
- Reset the game.

## My process

Initially, I got ready-to-use HTML tags and CSS rules. So I immediately started working on the game functionality. I generated the code for different scenarios
and tested it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

I learned working with console, logical operators, if/else if statements, event listeners and query selectors.


### Continued development

In the process of coming to the solution I had to make changes several times, It turned out to be kind of funny. 
To make this process easier I intend to learn Git.
